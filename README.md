# Cloud removal using SAR and optical images via attention mechanism-based GAN
This repository provides the PyTorch code for our paper “Cloud removal using SAR and optical images via attention mechanism-based GAN”. This code is based on the implementation of [Attention-GAN](https://github.com/xinyuanc91/Attention-GAN) and [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).
